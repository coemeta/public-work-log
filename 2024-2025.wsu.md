# Coεmeta Public Work Log 2024–2025 — Detours & Return to Dreaming <!-- omit in toc -->

## Winter Solstice Update (2025): Digital sabbatical, tending land & health    <!-- omit in toc -->

> This is the 9th [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) entry for [Coεmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of [working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to [knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) at any time, I'm happy to help however I can!

# 📜 Prologue & Epilogue ♻️: the short(ish) version
</summary>

### Backstory
</summary>

**_Coεmeta_** is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):
> _a more **potent & integrated** life in **greater community**_

<br>

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka "infinitely"), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.

<br>

> _(My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a [worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) or [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & partnerships with other "self-sovereign"_ **ɛ** _groups or entities. This is part of the "in greater community" aspect of the metagame.)_

<br>

So **Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional 'venture' or typical small business or startup etc**, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [first log entry](2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.

<br>

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)

<br>

ɛ NB: I'm generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized "[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)", but "independent" isn't quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration
</summary>

#### Digital Sabbatical

This is the first **[Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log)** update in over 2 years. I had already waived the white flag on quarterly updates, but didn't end up making biannual updates either, over the past 2 cycles. _(updates had also become chronically belated & abbreviated by this time)_

There are **several primary reasons** for this, along with a constellation of related circumstances:

I returned from my [cross-country car-life adventure](2023.3.wsu.md) at the end of 2023, but **wasn't able to settle back into a stable, permanent living situation until June 2024** — so life-admin logistics still loomed large, consuming bandwidth & spreading energies thin, etc.

Also during this time, I **began a new venture in repairing & reselling physical goods** (_more on this soon_), which also proved more bandwidth-consuming than expected.

Then, at the end of 2024, **2 major developments**:

1. **Bought some land in central New York** (❗) with a friend, with intentions of ecological restoration, off-grid experimentation & general vibing outdoors. (_— again, more on this soon_)
2. **Was beset with mysterious health issues** that persisted throughout the next year, necessitating several trips to the ER, recurring tests & specialist visits, many rounds of attempted cures, etc. Needless to say: this consumed a lot of time, energy, mental bandwidth, & not least of all: money.
   <details>
   <summary><i>(Trying not to gratuitously overshare OR vaguepost here, but worth stating:)</i></summary>

   - My condition has mostly stabilized (though not resolved) as of the end of 2025.
   - It was never an especially severe affliction as far as general health & quality of life, beyond all the disruption mentioned above, etc.
   - But it was & remains a serious condition that could become severe if not treated.

   </details>

<br>

In addition to all of the above, I **became increasingly disillusioned with social media & the whole [surveillance capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)**, for [obvious](https://x.com/dnlmc/status/1609268355277389827) & subtle reasons. This compounded my already [growing ambivalence towards digital technology more generally](2023.3.wsu.md#antecedents--adumbration). So the **"Work in Public" aspects of the mission became further complicated**.

- Will also mention **increasingly ambivalent feelings towards _writing_ itself** as a modality, medium, mode & form of communication & information. _(you guessed it... more on this soon)_

- And finally, **the whole project started to feel a bit over-conceptualized**, & to some extent, **under-realized**. Thus the poignant [coda of my last update](2023.3.wsu.md#-coda-eval--checkout) before "going dark":

    > ... & **more importantly**, **it was _lived_**, rather than merely conceived — & **_infinite games are for playing_**

    _...(& not for nothing, [vibe-maxing](2023.2.aeu.md#eval) did somewhat continue apace)_

<br>

Ultimately, all of that resulted in something of a **_digital sabbatical_** lasting roughly 2 years, at least as far as large-scale public platforms. 
- This was somewhat incidental but also somewhat deliberate, or at least consciously acknowledged & accepted.

I simply had to **prioritize health, paid work** & **real world engagements**, so "public presence", "content" & digital tool-making got crowded out ...for the time being.

<br>

#### Return to Dreaming

So while I did [**abdicate prior commitments to some original pillars & intents as initially conceived**](2022.3.wsu.md#-prologue--epilogue-️-a-tldr) — more deeply, I think I was **[living out](2023.2.aeu.md) the [metagame](#backstory) at new, deeper levels**.

_"A...more **balanced**, **integrated**...life..."_ was always part of the [original metagame formulation](#backstory) (which has been [revised & refined](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md#1-added-the-metagame) along with this partial digital reemergence).

- And although I stated this & meant it in deep, deliberate ways, _I realized I was still conceptualizing Coεmeta as **these things over here**, & the rest of my life as **those things over there**_. 
  - This is, of course, not very integrated, & makes true balance tricky. 
  - This is probably best illustrated simply by the [pillars](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md) (also due for a refresh) as well as my corresponding [time-tracking (& other associated metrics)](2023.3.wsu.md#eval): **Where is _health_?** **Where is _being in the world_?** ...etc

- So I found myself **drifting towards deeper integration, deeper balance** through **deeper commitment** to **health**, **engagement with the material world,** **real-world relations** & **collaborative, regenerative endeavors** — above increasingly degenerate & destructive digital bullshit.
- And despite some handwringing & pangs of shame over my (largely unavoidable) derelictions, eventually I realized: **this _is_ the way, the right path, the unfolding & evolving metagame**

<br>

Still, **I don't think the "optimal" amount of engagement in the digital wasteland is necessarily 0**. Of course, everything is more complex than that.

- _(like most things, it should probably be something more like [80:20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) ...and it ain't the 80)_
-  _(also [don't "optimize" your life](https://michaelgarfield.substack.com/p/dont-optimize-your-life) ....**[narrow optimization](https://medium.com/what-to-build/is-anything-worth-maximizing-d11e648eb56f) is the root of all [enshittification](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/enshittification)**)_

So I **always intended to reemerge at some point, in some way, to some degree**. But I **also had to reconceptualize** what that should look like, & how it should fit into this more integrated whole, this more complex structure that 4 pillars simply can't hold.

- I had made some **earlier gestures towards this sort of complexification & rebalancing** with the [8 forms of capital framework sketch](2023.0.veu.md#-timeline), & _tellingly I had to call out that it was "inclusive of my personal life as well as this work"_ — eesh.
  
- The major "new" dimensions of my life/work fit clearly here (if not perfectly in balance or in practice): 
  - recommitment to health
  - regenerative land stewardship 
    - (...ok ok I'll say the thing: _more on this soon_)
  - regenerative reselling 
    - (_don't make me say it_).

<br>

The **major theme** that emerged in this reconceptualization was to **refine & deepen**, to reflect the ways the metagame had evolved, expanded & deepened in actual gameplay.
- It wasn't a wholesale reimagining: **most of the essence was already there** in some way, just not adequately distributed or balanced. 
- Also, **the formulations & their many incarnations & permutations were getting a bit unwieldy**. Too much, yet somehow still inadequate. 
- So the goal was to **simplify at the first level**, but **weave nested & networked complexity underneath**.
- _This is a work in progress, but reflected in [these updated Mission & Vision statements](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md), the most distilled essences of these things_

<br>

The phrase _"**Return to Dreaming**"_ came to me through a poignant & pivotal divination session — a practice I employ semi-regularly as a _[stochastic strategy](https://x.com/dnlmc/status/1485786880981487620)_ which has proven particularly helpful & generative over the years. So it feels right to use here, as a flag in the ground, a statement of intent & a beacon for fellow dreamers.

### Eval
</summary>

The sort of data I used to post here in [previous updates](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log) (time-tracking & related metrics), long an [afterthought & mere formality](2023.0.veu.md#eval), is now fully obsolete (& actually technically broken) in its prior form. I've started to refresh that as well, & will likely share new versions in future updates.

But the numbers would anyway tell the same story as the narrative [above](#antecedents--adumbration) — just in the thinner, hollower way they do.

### Vibe Check
</summary>

Vibes have been a mixed bag, as you might expect given the [above](#antecedents--adumbration). But the gradual return to dreaming has also been regenerative on the vibes front. So we [play on](#backstory).
