> This is the fifth¬†[Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/)¬†entry for¬†[CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of¬†[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to¬†[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" &¬†leaving a trail + some resources¬†for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success.

# üìú Prologue: backstory & antecedents  
</summary>

<details>
<summary>

### Backstory  
</summary>

**_CoŒµmeta_** is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**  

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):   
>*a more **balanced**, **integrated**, **enriching** & **impactful** life in **greater community***

<br>

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka "infinitely"), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So CoŒµmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.  

> _(My longer-term vision for CoŒµmeta as a formal entity is something more like a _[worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative)_ or _[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)_ with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of _[mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29)_ & partnerships with other "self-sovereign"_ **·µã** _groups or entities. This is part of the "in greater community" aspect of the metagame.)_  

<br>

So **CoŒµmeta is not exactly a traditional 'venture' or typical small business or startup etc**, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [first log entry](2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.   

<br>

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)  

<br>

·µã NB: I'm generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized "[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)", but "independent" isn't quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration  
</summary>

This entry marks the **2nd _Vernal Equinox Update_**, & the first [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log) of this new cycle. The **[first VEU](2022.0.veu.md)** was also the first overall Public Work Log, & looking back now, it was **remarkably substantive & eventful**. This is largely due to the 6+ months of antecedents it included, but also the **richness of those first few months on this path**. I've now come **full circle in multiple senses** & am **beginning to feel that richness germinate again**, as described below.  

In contrast, I wrote the **[previous entry](2022.1.msu.md)** entirely in TL;DR format, due to **bandwidth & capacity constraints** resulting from an **overload of client work** (which [became](2022.0.veu.md#‚è≥-timeline) a [recurring](2022.1.msu.md#eval) [theme](2022.3.wsu.md#üìú-prologue--epilogue-‚ôªÔ∏è-a-tldr) throughout last cycle). I reflected on **predictable unpredictability, untested theories** & **neglected pillars of the original mission** over as my 1st year an independent worker. 

I also conveyed **gratitude & some validation** of my initial motivations & conceptions, & yet **lingering dissatisfaction** over the aforementioned untested theories & neglected pillars. So in the new year I made the difficult decision to **rebalance my workloads**, which meant **ending an engagement with a major client** in order to refocus my energy & efforts where they felt most vital. 

The past three months were largely consumed by that **transition, turnover & recovery** from the untenable imbalance. But by the end of it (at the time of writing), I'm **feeling back on track, rejuvenated & redoubled in my conviction** of this path.

# ‚è≥ Timeline 
</summary> 

_A brief timeline of relevant events, from the winter solstice of Dec 21, 2022, to the time of writing around the vernal equinox of March 20, 2023._   

_(see the full timeline to-date [here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/coemeta/page/EkP-exB0L))_

**Jan-Feb 2023**
</summary>

- **After regaining some clarity & grounding** over the holiday break, resolve to **give notice to a major client** that I'd have to end our engagement due to capacity constraints & being spread too thin.   
  - I had already rescoped this engagement several times to try to find a viable arrangement, but ultimately realized it was untenable, & the client deserved someone in the role that could bring sufficient attention & energy.  
  - Agreed to stay on through January under the current scope, then be available on a more limited basis for any remaining triage or troubleshooting throughout February, to ensure a thorough & seamless as possible turnover.  

- **Most of Jan & Feb spent tending to these transitions**, wrapping up end of year business admin stuff, & **using remaining energy reserves for a bit of (belated) forward-looking planning** for the next cycle, which I realized I couldn't kick off in earnest until next quarter.

**Mar 2023**  
</summary>

- **Start settling back into a tenable routine & regimen**   
  - Slowly realize that I'm actually **considerably burnt out again**, similar to the end times of my last full-time job, altho at a lower magnitude. So **give myself more space to recuperate** before plunging back into the game full force.   
    - _(I earned at least this much, via extended runway as well as general exertion)_  
  - Also **deeply appreciate having the flexibility & autonomy** to rebalance my work without upending my entire livelihood (again), which itself was [again]So I feel deeply gratified & substantially validated in my initial motivations & conception of this endeavor. And yet, not fully satisfied. There's still vital, fertile ground to explore. So I'm excited for this new cycle, to continue wayfinding & course-correcting: new plans, new ambitions, new directions, new journeys. ) **substantial validation of my initial motivations** in taking this path  
    - this doesn't mean I'll always make the best decision or procure the best outcome, but the mere capability is worth the risk, _& frankly I trust my judgement orders of magnitude more than 99% of those I'd otherwise have to defer to._  
- **More planning & ramping back up** 
  - **Revisiting / rebalancing [the pillars](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md)** 
    - As [mentioned](2022.1.msu.md) in the prior entry, **the first cycle both neglected & validated parts of the [strategic pillar model](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md#--strategic-pillar-2x2s--certainty-vs-scalability--feedback-loops--interdependencies)**. So I **didn't make many tweaks**, other than resolving to **rectify past neglect**, & **[OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) onward**.
    - In addition to **resetting time / effort allocations** as part of an **overhauled work portfolio strategy**, I did **revisit the substantive plans & sub-strategies** for the pillars a bit:  
      - **Client work**: obv...do less, more focused, higher-impact. Long game: other pillars eventually feed back here.  
      - **Relations / community-building**: no major shift, continue mutual capacity-building via crewing, mentorship & apprenticeship, focus remaining effort on communities & platforms with synergistic potential re: other pillars
      - **Content creation**: 2 major clusters:   
        - **Sensemaking / research / analysis projects** ‚Äî¬†to explore salient open quandaries, tinker with tools & methodologies (e.g. [this](https://medium.com/coemeta/barbells-fractals-memelords-scaling-strategies-for-ethical-action-cca9a868b8a1) & [this](https://medium.com/coemeta/ingroup-colossus-visakanv-744c08f408f2?sk=79d5a0c6880c38dc6c5e82d05c3a8383)), & add to the public portfolio  
        - **Conversations with folks** ‚Äî to feed into research, adapt for audio / video content, etc (on cross-pillar relevant themes obv)  
      - **Toolmaking**: as with other pillars, focus on synergies & feedback loops, building tools & resources to support these interlinked efforts. Particularly salient:   
        - **Sensemaking & analysis aids**  
        - **Affordances for mutual-capacity building,** especially among other feral freelance folks, & those looking to join our ranks. Will have more to say / show here soon.  
  - **Sketch out a rough [8 capital strategy](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/8-forms-of-capital/)**, to begin mapping & navigating a more holistic landscape of value:   
    - _inclusive of my personal life as well as this work, & partly inscrutable due to my personal Roam [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy), but intend to formalize for CoŒµmeta as well & add to the [Open Source Strategy Repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy)_  
    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.0.veu/8-capital-strategy-draft.png)  
  - **Set / update [OKRs](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/okrs.md)** for the first time in two quarters, as they became moot in the client work deluge  
    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.0.veu/okrs.png)  
    - _these largely map with the above 2 points, as they should_  
  - **Set general intentions** for the remaining year _(again, mapping with above)_:  
    - **Build on the foundation & extended runway** laid in the first cycle  
    - **Share & reinvest past harvests** in more mutual capacity-building   
    - **Get back to the core mission & vision**, incorporating lessons learned  
      - **Give the other pillars their due**, explore / experiment as originally intended  
      - **Have more courage of convictions, sooner** ‚Äî my intuition & weak-signal detection have repeatedly proven well-honed enough to give the benefit of the doubt, & the longer I defer their admonitions, the righter they get  
    - **Continue to course-correct & risk-mitigate** as needed, but mostly acclimate to the vicissitudes of the [permaweird](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-permaweird)  
- **Semi-impromptu trip to visit friends in the mountains** around the equinox provides much needed **rest & rejuvenation**, & **rekindles the initial spark** which set me on this path ‚Äî now accompanied by a year's worth of foundation & firewood  
  - <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i owe a vernal equinox public work log<br><br>but i spent the equinox in the mountains making fires with friends &amp; looking into glowing rectangles as little as possible<br><br>soon <a href="https://t.co/upJ7CBWC5v">https://t.co/upJ7CBWC5v</a> <a href="https://t.co/t6tIzSDt6A">pic.twitter.com/t6tIzSDt6A</a></p>&mdash; Daniel CoŒµmeta McNichol (@dnlmc) <a href="https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1641499861785665540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2023</a></blockquote>

### Eval  
</summary>

The numbers don't add much to the story here, but for completeness & continuity with [past entries](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log):  
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.0.veu/timetracking.png)  
    - _NB: my diligence re: non-billable time tracking also wavered a bit in the annotated `client glut` & `burnout` epochs, so everything but freelance is likely a bit understated_

### Vibe Check  
</summary>

But how are the vibes?  
> **Refreshed & renewed.** _Ready for more._   
> _...play started to become finite again, so had to reboot_  

I do feel **a bit behind the curve** of this new cycle, as **the prior year spilled over** & needed a cleanup. I'm only just rebooting now, 1/4 the way through. But **I feel good about weaving those threads of continuity into the knotwork of this next cycle**, yet more [strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop) in the [infinite game](#-prologue-backstory--antecedents).
