# CoŒµmeta Public Work Log 2023.1.MSU ‚Äî Reinvesting the Harvest  <!-- omit in toc -->

## Midsummer Solstice Update (6/21/2023): Strange loops & new knots    <!-- omit in toc -->
> This is the sixth [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/)¬†entry for¬†[CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of¬†[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to¬†[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" &¬†leaving a trail + some resources¬†for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) at any time, I'm happy to help however I can!

# üìú Prologue: backstory & antecedents  
</summary>

<details>
<summary>

### Backstory  
</summary>

**_CoŒµmeta_** is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**  

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):   
>*a more **balanced**, **integrated**, **enriching** & **impactful** life in **greater community***

<br>

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka "infinitely"), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So CoŒµmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.  

> _(My longer-term vision for CoŒµmeta as a formal entity is something more like a _[worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative)_ or _[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)_ with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of _[mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29)_ & partnerships with other "self-sovereign"_ **·µã** _groups or entities. This is part of the "in greater community" aspect of the metagame.)_  

<br>

So **CoŒµmeta is not exactly a traditional 'venture' or typical small business or startup etc**, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [first log entry](2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.   

<br>

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)  

<br>

·µã NB: I'm generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized "[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)", but "independent" isn't quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration  
</summary>

This is the **2nd cycle of [Public Work Logs](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log)**, & the **2nd __Midsummer Solstice Update__**. **Last [midsummer update](2022.1.msu.md)** I was **[shifting to a more outward focus](2022.1.msu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) & emerging from [long-sought](#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) balance to seize new opportunities** (which would ultimately vanquish all balance until well into this year). That dynamic [persisted](2023.0.veu.md#antecedents--adumbration) until **[last update](2023.0.veu.md)**, where I described **[difficult decisions](2023.0.veu.md#-prologue-backstory--antecedents) needed to rebalance, refocus & recover ‚Äî eventually feeling rejuvenated** enough to **[revisit + recommit to neglected pillars of the original mission](2023.0.veu.md#-timeline)**.

Since then, I've gone a bit ...off script: **got an apartment-sitter for the summer, bought a used electric car, set out on an indefinite car-life adventure to visit friends & family & play in the woods**, etc. Also **eventually got back around to the whole neglected pillars thing**.

# ‚è≥ Timeline

_A brief timeline of relevant events, from the vernal equinox of March 20, 2023, to the time of writing around the midsummer solstice of June 21, 2023._

**April 2023**
</summary>

- After a **[deep reset & recalibration](2023.0.veu.md#-timeline), begin executing on refocused plans & intentions**, starting with researching & spec‚Äôing affordances for freelancer / indie worker collaboration & mutual aid, & exploring existing platforms & communities:
  - [Yak Collective](https://www.yakcollective.org/)
  - [Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/)
  - Un-Musk'd Twitter alternatives [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) & [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)
  - *(also via continued relational activities: crewing, mentorship & apprenticeship)*
- And thennnnn .......**decided to buy a used electric car, have a friend apartment-sit for the summer, & do some regional car-life [slomadding](https://traveltomorrow.com/what-is-a-digital-slomad/) to visit friends & family, camp, etc**
  - This entailed lots of car research & apartment prep etc, which ...is time-consuming
  - _(#content forthcoming)_
- Also **come to terms with the fact** that like, **I just don‚Äôt wanna work that much** lol.
  - No hustle culture grindset here: **_I just wanna vibe, strategically_**
  - (also, I'm due for a pendulum swing, as [hyperopic balance](2022.1.msu.md#-timeline) demands ...& will swing back at some point)

### Eval  
</summary>

And again for [continuity](2023.0.veu.md#-coda-eval--checkout) if nothing else, the numbers tell a thin, reductive version of the story:
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.1.msu/time_tracking.png)
      - __the **[workload rebalancing](#antecedents--adumbration) across the pillars** is apparent here, as is the **June impact of [forrest / mountain life](#-timeline)**__
          - __(this rebalancing & resource reallocation also reflects **progress towards my nascent [8 capital strategy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.0.veu/8-capital-strategy-draft.png)**)__
      - __NB also: I'm **still struggling a bit to be at ease with [hyperopic balance](#-timeline)**, still some psychic hangups & lingering feelings I should be doing more conventional "work" at most times. So **having frameworks & rituals like this to zoom out & recalibrate has been invaluable**.__
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.1.msu/metrics.png)
      - __(targets are not prorated ...still lacking in tool & content output...but finally working on it)__
  - 
  - ... & a glance at the [recently rebooted OKRs](2023.0.veu.md#-timeline) for completeness:

### Vibe Check  
</summary>

& as for the vibes:
    **Immaculate as ever**
    _...the path feels truer by the day, & my gratitude & appreciation grows in turn_

I'm consciously **cashing in on lifestyle credit accrued during [last cycle's overload & burnout](2023.0.veu.md#-coda-eval--checkout)**, & know that **[hyperopic rebalancing](#-timeline) will come calling again**. And I'm here for it. This is **the way of the [infinite game](#backstory)**.
