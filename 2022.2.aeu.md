# CoŒµmeta Public Work Log 2022.2.AEU ‚Äî Vacation & Re(a)lation  <!-- omit in toc -->

## Autumnal Equinox Update (9/22/2022): rest, real relation, realignment, recalibration   <!-- omit in toc -->
> This is the third [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/)¬†entry for¬†[CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of¬†[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to¬†[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" &¬†leaving a trail + some resources¬†for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) at any time, I'm happy to help however I can!

</summary>

### Backstory  
</summary>

**_CoŒµmeta_** is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**  

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):   
>*a more **balanced**, **integrated**, **enriching** & **impactful** life in **greater community***

<br>

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka "infinitely"), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So CoŒµmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.  

> _(My longer-term vision for CoŒµmeta as a formal entity is something more like a _[worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative)_ or _[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)_ with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of _[mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29)_ & partnerships with other "self-sovereign"_ **·µã** _groups or entities. This is part of the "in greater community" aspect of the metagame.)_  

<br>

So **CoŒµmeta is not exactly a traditional 'venture' or typical small business or startup etc**, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [first log entry](2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.   

<br>

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of the first two entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)  

<br>

·µã NB: I'm generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized "[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)", but "independent" isn't quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration  
</summary>

In the **[previous entry](/2022.1.msu.md)**, I **reported good vibes & gratitude** for progress towards a **more outward focus & mutual capacity-building**, & **new opportunities** (once again) thanks to luck & the kindness of others.   

I also discussed how **some prior balance gave way to seizing those opportunities**, & noted **looming risks & shadows**, some of which have grown closer & longer. But I also **looked forward to continued cultivation & harvest**, & wrestling with ideas of **further scaling (or sporing)** these efforts for **greater impact & a greater common good**.  
  
The intervening 3 months mostly revolved around late summer **vacations & more real-world engagement**, + _preparing for_ & _recovering from_ those things. All of that, alongside a **full plate of client workloads**, left **little time for other [pillar](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md) work: public toolmaking & content creation**. So this entry is shorter & less substantive than the others: I've done much less public work (& frankly, less private work on internal business stuff as well).

# ‚è≥ Timeline

_A brief timeline of relevant events, from the midsummer solstice of June 2022, to the time of writing around the autumnal equinox of Sep 22, 2022._

**Jul-Sep 2022**  
</summary>

 - Mostly a **blur of vacations, tending to real-world relations, & recovering & recalibrating**

  - **Prioritize client work with remaining attention & energy**, while **maintaining** previously established **mutual-capacity building efforts** via crewing, mentorship & apprenticeship

### Eval  
</summary>

My still-provisional **metrics** tracking framework [again](2022.1.msu.md#eval) **tells the story pretty clearly**:
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.2.aeu/time_tracking.png)
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.2.aeu/target_metrics.png)
  - __**Freelance client work drowned out all other efforts**, while **overall effort declined** due to (much needed) summer vacations etc__

Predictably, as in [Q2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdBfK9FYPXAVAoHKcvjufuq5_6Hso2KmdGZGU8ChG8g/edit?usp=sharing), my [Q3 OKRs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17A9nv2-wEIH5hiiCrrNYSSmv6eFlKlLDqBKcdoIErQg/edit?usp=sharing) reflect the same imbalances described above. But revenue-related & [outcome](https://www.perdoo.com/resources/outcomes-vs-outputs/)-focused results were bright spots:
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.2.aeu/okrs.png)

And again, some of these will roll over to next quarter, where I hope to not only rebalance across the longer [time-average](2022.1.msu.md#-timeline), but also recalibrate my overall objectives ahead of year two of the CoŒµmeta journey

### Vibe Check  
</summary>

And on to what really matters: the vibe check...
    
> **I feel great**, & **more alive** to the world than I have in a while. (albeit more the world of __atoms__ than __bits__)

The **[balance](2022.0.veu.md#vibe-check)** of the early months (& the [metagame](#backstory)) **remains elusive**, & **[shadows](2022.1.msu.md#vibe-check) still loom**. But I'm **deeply grateful for the good fortune & generosity** I've experienced so far, & for the **opportunities to share the harvest** & reinvest in mutual capacity-building. I'll continue to grapple with these opportunities, & the challenges of scaling impact & rebalancing my efforts, while revisiting & reaffirming [the mission](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md) for this next cycle.
