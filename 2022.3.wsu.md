# CoŒµmeta Public Work Log 2022.3.WSU ‚Äî Cycle Completion  <!-- omit in toc -->

## Winter Solstice Update (12/21/2022): good problems & the first cycle complete   <!-- omit in toc -->
> This is the fourth [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/)¬†entry for¬†[CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of¬†[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to¬†[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" &¬†leaving a trail + some resources¬†for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) at any time, I'm happy to help however I can!

# üìú Prologue & Epilogue ‚ôªÔ∏è: a TL;DR
</summary>

- A **full year has passed** since embarking on this journey, the first full cycle complete. 
    - **Predictably, things didn't go quite as predicted**: I expected to test & learn on several fronts, but never got to test some theories, & instead learned things I didn't expect. 
    - **All told, things went better than I could have hoped** on the most fundamental "bottom-line" matters, mostly due to the kindness & generosity of others -- for which I'm tremendously grateful & fortunate.
    - **But vital [pillars](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md) of the broader [mission](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md) went largely neglected** as a consequence, & **the [vision itself evolved](2022.2.aeu.md#-timeline)** (as expected) in response to experience gained & lessons learned.
        - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.3.wsu/pillars.png)

<br>

- Regarding the **initial [pillars](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md)**, a **brief assessment**:
    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.3.wsu/metrics.png)
    - **freelance**: __far too much__
    - **relation**: __adequate__
    - **content**: __very little__
    - **public toolmaking**: __very little__

<br>

- **The [center / bottom-right quadrants of the mutant 2x2](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md#--strategic-pillar-2x2s--certainty-vs-scalability--feedback-loops--interdependencies) got the lion's share of effort & attention**, which generally validated at least those portions of the model. A few notable observations:
    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2022.3.wsu/pillars_2x2.png)
    - **I'm naturally inclined towards high signal / low noise channels** anyway, so when opportunities arose there I pursued them, for both **tactical & dispositional reasons**. 
    - **Freelance client work turned out, [as expected](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/frameworks/pillars-and-2x2s.md#--strategic-pillar-2x2s--certainty-vs-scalability--feedback-loops--interdependencies), to be high-certainty & low-scalability**: low risk/reward ratio, little chance of asymmetric payoffs.  
        - **So this part "worked"**, & has its place in the portfolio, **but I over-indexed**, & at times felt like I never left FTE life. (which was ....not the plan)
    - So **I played the hand that was dealt, exploring opportunities & also mitigating looming risks** (recession, etc), but was also able to **leverage excess client demand to further build partnerships & relationships** of exchange & mutual support ‚Äî which was also always a critical piece of the mission. 
        - But this was again in **high signal / small scale** scenarios (a la [microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) & [squad wealth](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/), which remain inspirations).
    - And the more **Public Work pillars of content & tool creation were crowded out**, but I did feel good about **supporting the public work of clients**: from [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)'s [tremendous program expansion](https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2022/07/06/investing-in-a-civic-media-movement) to [The Baltimore Banner](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com)'s launch, to a new engagement with a local Public Broadcasting network. 
        - In fact this contributed to the aforementioned [evolution & refinement of the mission itself](2022.2.aeu.md#-timeline): as a **lever for impact**

<br>

- So **I feel deeply gratified & substantially validated** in my initial motivations & conception of this endeavor. And yet, **not fully satisfied**. There's still vital, fertile ground to explore. So **I'm excited for this new cycle, to continue wayfinding & course-correcting**: new plans, new ambitions, new directions, new journeys. 
    - I'll have more to say (& hopefully show) on this in a future update. But suffice to say that **the [metagame](2022.0.veu.md#backstory) endures, & it's best in multiplayer mode**.
