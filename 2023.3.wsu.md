# Coεmeta Public Work Log 2023.3.WSU — Relational Pilgrimage <!-- omit in toc -->

## Winter Solstice Update (12/21/2023): Full(er) Circle(s)    <!-- omit in toc -->

> This is the 8th [Public Work Log](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/) entry for [Coεmeta](https://coemeta.xyz/), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as a window into our journey & playbook as it develops, in the spirit of [working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public), contributing to [knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons), "finding the others" & leaving a trail + some resources for those that follow. I hope it inspires more folks to follow a similarly rewarding path & find similar (if modest & provisional) success. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:daniel@coemeta.com) at any time, I'm happy to help however I can!  

_**- Daniel McNichol**_, founder & Chief Scientist

# 📜 Prologue: backstory & antecedents

### Backstory
</summary>

**_Coεmeta_** is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). **The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing.**   

I consider this the _metagame_ (as opposed to endgame):    
>*a more **balanced**, **integrated**, **enriching** & **impactful** life in **greater community***

<br>

To pursue this metagame indefinitely (aka "infinitely"), I needed to reclaim some agency & autonomy in my work. So Coεmeta is also currently a [Pennsylvania Public Benefit LLC](https://coemeta.notion.site/coemeta/Co-meta-co-eh-meta-Data-Sensemaking-Services-9b764a49e7644703a64eda8f95084156#b97ace661ee84e81816b67d947ddbf53), serving as a vehicle for more traditional freelance & consulting work, as well as broader public-benefit oriented activities.   

<br>

> _(My longer-term vision for Coεmeta as a formal entity is something more like a [worker-owned cooperative](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative) or [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) with shared collective ownership, or at least part of a federated network of [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & partnerships with other "self-sovereign"_ **ɛ** _groups or entities. This is part of the "in greater community" aspect of the metagame.)_   

<br>

So **Coεmeta is not exactly a traditional 'venture' or typical small business or startup etc**, but assumes some of those trappings for now. The [first log entry](2022.0.veu.md) recaps more of the motivations & considerations underlying all of this, & our [Open Source Strategy repo](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy) describes some of the strategic planning & wayfinding models used so far.     

<br>  

As elaborated throughout these artifacts, **public work & contributing to knowledge commons are core parts of the overall metagame strategy & ethos**. So these posts are part of that: figuring it out as I go, learning while doing, in public. This entry picks up where the previous left off. (The timing & titles of these entries should make the intended heliocentric publishing cadence clear.)   

<br>

ɛ NB: I'm generally skeptical of this terminology & its associations with neoliberal / libertarian fantasies of fully atomized "[sovereign individuals](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/)", but "independent" isn't quite adequate either.

### Antecedents & adumbration
</summary>   

This is the **4th & final entry** of the **2nd cycle of [Public Work Logs](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log)**. **[Last update](2023.2.aeu.md) was mostly a sequel**, describing my **ongoing car-life adventure**, **cashed-in lifestyle credit** & **reinvestment of past harvests across a broader "8 capital" portfolio**. And despite the **customary summer precedence of vacation & real-world relations** (on top of compounding [life-admin logistics](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1693840013300306233)), **[pillars](2022.3.wsu.md#-prologue--epilogue-♻️-a-tldr) remained intact & fortified** — as I actively _**lived the [metagame](#backstory)**_.   

<br>

This entry marks **[another completed cycle](2022.3.wsu.md)**, coming **full-circle in multiple senses**: circumnavigating the country & returning home to close out the year, weaving _**yet more** strange loops in the endless knot_. Since this update is relegated to TL;DR form, I can't say much about all of that, but a few notes:   

<br>

**I began to conceive of this ~year long roadtrip as a _relational pilgrimage_**, motivated by a small complex of intertwined threads:

1. **Post-lockdown / covid cabin fever** — exacerbated by fully remote, mostly-solo-preneurship

2. **A growing, stirring call back to the physical world** — away from glowing rectangular portals to endless abstraction & disembodied information. _(probably related to #1)_
   - _(i never did start baking bread etc during covid, so guess i was overdue)_

3. **Feeling the continued fraying & diffusion of my own social fabric** — many of my deepest, oldest friends scattered around the country (& world)
   - ...part of what I'm [starting to conceptualize](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1688664846764482561) as _**"relational enclosure"**_ (or something), in my personal microcosm

4. **Disenchantment with concrete jungles** — epicenters of our ossifying civilization & its sclerotic institutions
   - _(...but not without [some ambivalence](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1672306624516571136))_

<br>

... & as such it **fits firmly in the originally conceived pillars of Coεmeta**, as well the **rebalancing / _holistic-ating_ intent of the more recent [8 capital strategy](2023.0.veu.md#eval)**   

... & **more importantly**, **it was _lived_**, rather than merely conceived — & _**[infinite games](#backstory) are for playing**_

<br>

I think **that's all I have** to say here...   

_(but on this abrupt note of reticence: I have decided to face facts & stop aiming for quarterly updates here, keeping with the theme of **doing** more & **thinking / writing / saying** less etc. Will now aim for twice-yearly updates, on the solstices)_

The data for continuity:

      - _I was able to **ramp back up freelance hours**, as new & old clients (re)emerged: as I had [reassured myself](2023.1.msu.md#-coda-eval--checkout), the pendulum swung & **hyperoperic balance prevailed**_ 
  - ![Coεmeta Metrics Winter 2023](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coemeta/public-work-log/main/media/2023.3.wsu/metrics.png)
      - _I again **landed above my (relatively modest) revenue goals** for the year, **despite a dramatic rebalancing & reinvestment of revenue into [other forms of capital](2023.0.veu.md#eval)**_
